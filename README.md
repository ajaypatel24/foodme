# foodme ![Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/larakollokian/foodme.svg?token=s9wt5vK6yqsBSVx5Xszv&branch=master)


Foodme is a Android app designed to allow users to get restaurant recommendations based on their current location and food preferences.

The way foodme works is that a user begins by creating an optional account or they can continue using the app without one. 

By creating an account users have access to additional features such as if they wish to have their preference history saved it will be saved in their account, as well as if they wish to have a personal list of their favourite/least favourite restaurant spots, they have the ability to save those within their account in their personalized "liked/disliked" lists.
